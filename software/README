HOLDER FOR DRC README - MFALLON JUNE 2012
==========================

This is the code base for the Envoy project. 

Overview
========

envoy is a collection of several pieces of software (pods).  Some pods
may depend on others.  The current list of pods is:



External Dependencies
====================

In addition to providing its own pods, envoy depends upon third party
pod collections via an svn:externals dependency for
envoy/software/collections. These include

  libot2
  ======

  bot2-core       C library with some simple but useful routines,
                  and a set of core message types (LCM types).

  bot2-vis        C library of classes and functions for visualizing data
                  with OpenGL and GTK2.

  bot2-lcmgl      Transmitting and rendering OpenGL commands over LCM.

  bot2-procman    Process management tools for controlling many processes 
                  on one or many workstations.

  bot2-lcm-utils  LCM utility programs (tunnel LCM over TCP, chop or splice
                  log files, etc.)

Requirements
============

  (This list may not be up-to-date. See the individual README files in
  the third party pod collections for newer dependencies.)

  These are required.
    GLib 2.0+
    CMake
    LCM       (http://lcm.googlecode.com)
    Java      (Sun JDK or OpenJDK strongly preferred)
    Python
    GTK+ 2.0+ (required by bot2-vis)
    OpenGL    (required by bot2-vis)
    GLUT
    PyGTK
    Camunits (http://camunits.googlecode.com)
    GSL

  Note that some pods may have fewer requirements (e.g., if you just want
  bot2-core)

  On a Debian/Ubuntu system, the following packages should be sufficient:
    libglib2.0-dev
    cmake
    sun-java6-jdk | default-jdk | openjdk-6-jdk
    python-dev
    python-gtk2
    libgtk2.0-dev
    mesa-common-dev
    libgl1-mesa-dev
    libglu1-mesa-dev
    freeglut3-dev
    libjpeg8-dev
    ant
    libsuitesparse-dev
    eigen3 (As of July 6 2011: Not available via apt. Must be installed manually.)

  On OS X, the recommended procedure is to use MacPorts and install:
    cmake
    pkgconfig
    glib2
    gtk2
    atk
    cairo
    python2X (X=6 or 7)
    py2X-gtk
    py2X-gobject
    pango
    mesa
    eigen3
    SuiteSparse
    gsl-devel    

    Additionally, you'll need to install LCM from http://lcm.googlecode.com

(Local) Installation
====================
  envoy adheres to the Pods core policy, and makes use of the Pods build tools. 
  For more information about Pods, see: https://sourceforge.net/p/pods/

  You can install envoy to your system by running:

  $ sudo make BUILD_PREFIX=/usr/local

  If you don't want to install envoy to your system, you can also build it
  inside the source directory.  To do this, run:

  $ make
  
  In this case, the executables, headers, libraries etc. will be
  installed according to the Pods core policy. If no other "build"
  directory is found, it will default to: envoy/build/

Uninstallation
==============

  If compiled and installed to your system, run:

  $ sudo make clean

  note: this can only be done from the envoy source that was used for
        installation

Documentation
=============

  To build documentation, install Doxygen and then run:

  $ cd doc
  $ doxygen

  HTML docs will then be build to doc/html/

License
=======

  TBD for envoy.

  libbot2 falls under the LGPL3 license.
